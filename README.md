# Rust Programming Language: Examples and Learning Repository

Welcome to the **Rust Programming Language** repository! This repository is a practical space to explore, test, and understand the concepts and capabilities of Rust through the examples and projects outlined in _The Rust Programming Language_ book.

## Overview

Rust is a systems programming language that emphasizes safety, speed, and concurrency. This repository is dedicated to implementing the examples and projects from the book, enabling hands-on learning for developers at any stage of their Rust journey.

### What You'll Find Here:

- **Concept Examples**: Code snippets to illustrate key Rust concepts.
- **Projects**: Practical applications like a number guessing game, a subset of the `grep` command, and a low-level multithreaded web server.
- **Error Exploration**: Examples of compiler error messages and their resolutions.
- **Advanced Topics**: Hands-on demonstrations of closures, smart pointers, concurrency, and more.

## Chapters and Projects

### Getting Started

- **Chapter 1**: Installation, writing a "Hello, world!" program, and an introduction to Cargo, Rust's package manager and build tool.
- **Chapter 2**: Build a **Number Guessing Game** as a first Rust project.

### Core Concepts

- **Chapter 3**: Common Rust features like variables, data types, and functions.
- **Chapter 4**: Ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes.
- **Chapter 5**: Structs and methods.
- **Chapter 6**: Enums and pattern matching.

### Projects

- **Chapter 12**: Build a **Mini-Grep Tool** to search for text in files.
- **Chapter 20**: Create a **Multithreaded Web Server**.

### Advanced Topics

- **Chapter 10**: Generics, traits, and lifetimes.
- **Chapter 13**: Closures and iterators.
- **Chapter 15**: Smart pointers.
- **Chapter 16**: Concurrency in Rust.
